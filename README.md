Performing a query with Chronicle 


Chronicle is a powerful and efficient distributed logging and event sourcing framework that allows you to store and query vast amounts of data in a chronological order. Performing a query with Chronicle involves the following steps:

Evaluation of my Query Search Results. After constructing and executing your query in Chronicle, i evaluated the search results. This involves reviewing the retrieved data to identify any patterns, anomalies, or potential security issues. I analyzed the query results using statistical analysis techniques, data visualization tools, or other methods to gain insights into the data.

Investigation of Threat Intelligence Data. Within the query search results, i specifically investigated the threat intelligence data. This step involves examining the relevant data points related to known threats, malicious actors, vulnerabilities, or indicators of compromise. By analyzing this data, i can aim to understand the nature and severity of potential threats and their impact on your systems or network.

Ivestigation of Affected Assets and Events. In this step, I focused on investigating the affected assets and events identified in the query results. This may include analyzing logs, system data, or other relevant information related to the assets (servers, endpoints, applications) and events ( security incidents, unusual activities). By examining these details, I aimed to determine the scope, timeline, and potential impact of the identified security events or incidents.

Investigation of Solved IP Addresses. In this last step we analyze the IP addresses linked to resolved security issues. By examining these addresses, i aimed to identify the root causes, detect patterns or trends, and implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.
